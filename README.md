# Blogify Project
 Blogify Project

I created this project using all the technologies I learned during my SNI Technology internship.

Project Objective: To develop the backend of a blog website where users can register, create profiles, write and share articles, and leave comments.

In this project, I aimed to adhere to SOLID principles and utilized a layered architectural structure with separate packaging for each functionality. Below, you can find the technologies I used:

- Spring Boot
- Hibernate-JPA
- Rest API
- Flyway
- Docker
